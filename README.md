# Motor-Test-Data
This is a repository for motor test data done in house at QuadQuestions. The data is organized by each motor, then ESC, then propellor. For example, the data for a T-Motor MN2205 with a Little Bee 30A ESC and 5 inch HQ 5x4x3 props would be found in T-Motor_MN2205/Little_Bee_30/HQ5x4x3.
Each combo is tested on a RC Benchmark 1580 Dynamometer with a charged 4S battery at 4Ah. CSV files are available for each test along with a avergaed csv outlining important information. Plots are also available on our blog posts at quadquestions.com.
